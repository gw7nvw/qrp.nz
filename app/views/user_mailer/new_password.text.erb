Hello <%@user.callsign %>

Welcome to the new website for the QRPers NZ group.

QRPers NZ is moving its newsletters, contests, awards and competitions onto the group website https://qrp.nz to make running the group that bit easier.  The website also provides chat forums, maps and much more.

You have been subscribed to the website because you are an existing QRPers NZ group member.  By default you have been registered only to receive copies of the newsletters and bulletins.

If you want to participate in the forums, contests, competitions or the group's awards you will need to set a password for your account on our site.  This can be done by clicking the link below:
<% Rails.application.routes.default_url_options[:host] = 'qrp.nz' %>
<%= edit_password_reset_url(@user.reset_token, email: @user.email) %>

Once you have set a password you will be able to update you email preferences to receive more or less information from the site.

If you do not want to receive newsletters or other messages from the group, you can follow the link above and turn off the newsletter email option on your profile page. Alternatively email me: admin@qrp.nz and I'll be happy to disable them for you.

73's from Matt, ZL4NVW - on behalf of QRP.NZ
